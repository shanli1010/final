      Imagine scrolling through your daily feed on social media, and you come across an influencer that at first glance, seems like a real person. Then, you get a little curious and start zooming into the photo, without being able to pinpoint what’s wrong with the picture. When you stare for longer, you suddenly realize you’re staring at an ultramodern work of graphic design, curated so meticulously that without careful analysis, you may have never been able to tell the difference between reality and fantasy.

       Animated influencers, a brand new way to incorporate brand marketing with technological development, have become increasingly popular. Although 100% fabricated, these cartoon “characters” are so advanced that their motions resemble human movement to a tee. Our ability to ignore the fourth wall and utilize our willing suspension of disbelief is something we do while watching movies and cartoons, but this time, we are using this mechanism on a different platform—one that we associate with our present reality. A designed graphic is pretending to update you on their day-to-day lives, mimicking a real human being without the self awareness of being an animation. If you’re not familiar with acting terminology, the willing suspension of disbelief means “the people in the audience know that what they are seeing on stage or screen is a pretend reality, but they are pretending that they do not know that” (Hooks). This philosophy creates the illusion needed to enjoy whatever show, play or facade in front of your eyes. But when does this captivation become dangerously realistic? What does this say about real influencers who put in the same effort, provide the same content, and actually show their face? Does this make them seem more fabricated or fake because we realize to the human eye deception comes easily? Nevertheless, if they’re so great and easy to manipulate, why not replace all influencers with these realistic cartoon characters?
