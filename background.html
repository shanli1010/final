      Imagine scrolling through your daily feed on social media, and you come across an influencer that at first glance, seems like a real person. Then, you get a little curious and start zooming into the photo, without being able to pinpoint what’s wrong with the picture. When you stare for longer, you suddenly realize you’re staring at an ultramodern work of graphic design, curated so meticulously that without careful analysis, you may have never been able to tell the difference between reality and fantasy.
